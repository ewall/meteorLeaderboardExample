# Meteor Leaderboard Example #

As an effort to learn the Meteor JavaScript framework, I'm checking out the [Leaderboard example code](http://meteor.com/examples/leaderboard) and extending it as suggested in the "Make Some Changes" section.

1.) Make a button that toggles between sorting by score and sorting by name. Hint: use a Session variable to hold the current sort choice. --> **DONE**

2.) Make a button that resets everyone's score to a random number. --> **DONE**

3.) Implement a way to add and remove scientists from the leaderboard. --> **DONE**
